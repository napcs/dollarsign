# Dollarsign

When I'm following tutorials, I will occasionally copy a dollar sign with the command:

```
$ curl http://example.com
```

Then my terminal hates me.

So what if I made a program that just executes the command after the dollar sign?

And it wasn't that hard. So here it is, in all its tiny glory..

## Install

Download the version you need from the releases page and save it to your path.

## Usage

```
$ ls
```

Prints the directory listing.

Even works with interactive things like `less`:

```
$ less
```

And even things like `top`:

```
$ top
```

### Limitations

Probably tons of stuff I'm not even thinking about. Patches welcome.
